            <p> The key here is that we have a const variable named App which is of type React.FC or Functional
                Component. React promotes 2 types of components: Class Components and Functional Components. The idea of
                a Functional Component is that it is a pure function; pure meaning - its return value is only determined
                by the input values (it does not use-values outside of those passed to it as input), its return values
                are always the same given the same input. Pure functions are the way to be as they are much easier to
                encapsulate, test, maintain, and read. By design, functional components are stateless; meaning they do
                not have access to state or have a lifcecyle; this was until the addition of hooks in React 16.8. Now
                with hooks, we can use React Functional Components that interact with our state as well. Hooks are
                amazing and I will be writing another post about hooks in this article series; stay tuned. React works
                on the component concept that allows us to build components and then compose them together. Our App
                component defined here will be our top-level component where we will compose our other components as
                children. I like to think of this as our App shell where we can define components that will be shared
                across our app; things such as our app header, with navigation, authenticated user info, etc; an app
                footer if needed, our top-level route definitions if needed; etc. We will build a couple of components
                in this article and add them to this App component. App Header To start, let’s create a header component
                that will sit at the top of our app; show the app title, a short description, and a couple of navigation
                links. Create a folder inside of ./src named containers; this is where we will place smart “containing”
                components. <br>
