## Features

- Backend server using Express.js and Node.js
- Frontend client using React.js
- MongoDB for data storage
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Form validation on the client side
- Error handling and validation on the server side

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-starter-kit.git
```

# MERN Starter Kit - Folder Structure

This is a basic outline of the folder structure for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project. It helps to organize the code and provides a clear separation between the client and server components.

## Folder Structure
```
mern-starter-kit/
|-- client/
| |-- public/
| |-- src/
| | |-- components/
| | |-- pages/
| | |-- App.js
| | |-- index.js
| |-- package.json
|
|-- server/
| |-- controllers/
| |-- models/
| |-- routes/
| |-- utils/
| |-- app.js
| |-- server.js
|-- .env
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

The folder structure is organized as follows:

- `client/`: This folder contains the client-side code written in React.js. It includes the `public/` directory for static assets and the `src/` directory for all React components and pages. The entry point for the client-side code is typically `index.js`, and the main component is usually `App.js`. Additionally, the `package.json` file manages the client-side dependencies.

- `server/`: This folder contains the server-side code written in Express.js and Node.js. It includes various subfolders for organizing the code:
  - `controllers/`: This folder holds the controllers responsible for handling the business logic and request/response handling.
  - `models/`: This folder contains the database models or schemas using an Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library like Mongoose.
  - `routes/`: This folder contains the route definitions for different API endpoints.
  - `utils/`: This folder contains utility functions or helper files used across the server codebase.
  - `app.js`: The main Express.js application file that sets up middleware, routes, and other configurations.
  - `server.js`: The entry point of the server-side code that starts the server.
  
- `.env`: This file stores environment variables required for the application, such as database connection string, server port, or secret keys.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and folders that should be ignored by version control systems like Git.

- `package.json`: This file manages the project dependencies and scripts for both the client and server.

- `README.md`: The README file provides an overview and documentation for the project.

Feel free to modify this folder structure according to your project's specific requirements. Remember to keep your code organized and maintain consistency throughout the project.
